# DynamicProgramming-allSums
In this assignment, given an array, we should return a sorted list of all the sums that can be reached using any sub array from the given array.
In the MainTrain file there is a naive algorithm.
In the solution file I used Dynamic Programming to achieve the same result in an optimaized way.
